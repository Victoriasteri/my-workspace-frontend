# API Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: For production, use API_URL (without NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix).
# This keeps the API URL server-side only and prevents it from being exposed in the client bundle.
#
# For local development, the app defaults to http://localhost:3000 if not set.
#
# Copy this file to .env.local and update the values for your local development.
# The .env.local file is gitignored and will not be committed.

# Server-side API URL (recommended for production)
# This is used by the internal /api/config endpoint and is NOT exposed to the client bundle.
# Set this in your deployment platform's environment variables for production.
API_URL=

# Client-side API URL (fallback, not recommended for production)
# Only use this if you need the URL in the client bundle (not recommended for security).
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=

# Example for local development (optional, defaults to http://localhost:3000):
# API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Example for production:
# API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
